<h2>What Is Yoga?</h2>


<p>“I think it is better I tell you what is not yoga. So much misinterpretation of the word has happened that speaking about what is not yoga is more relevant. Standing on your head,  holding  your  breath  or  twisting  your  body  is  not  yoga.  Yes,  these  are  various yogic practices, but when we say “yoga” we are referring to a certain state—a certain way of being. The word “yoga” means union.</p>

<h4>Yoga means to unite the limited with the unlimited. - Sadhguru</h4>

<p>Union  means  you  begin  to  experience  the  universality  of  who  you  are.  For  example, today, modern science proves to you beyond any doubt that the whole Existence is just one  energy  manifesting  itself  in  various  forms.  If  this  scientific  fact  becomes  a  living reality  for  you  and  you  begin  to  experience  everything  as  one,  then  you  are  in  yoga.  Once  you  experience  yourself  as  everything,  or  everything  as  yourself,  after  that nobody has to tell you how to be in this world. If you experience all the people here as yourself, does anybody have to teach you morals as to how to be? Does anybody have to tell you “don’t harm this person, don’t kill this person and don’t rob this person?” So when  you  are  in  yoga,  you  experience  everything  as  a  part  of  yourself,  and  that  is mukti; that is ultimate freedom.</p>

<p>Yoga  is  a  science.  Yoga  has  nothing  to  do  with  any  particular  religion.  As  there  are physical sciences to create external wellbeing, yoga is the science for inner wellbeing. This yogic science is of utmost importance now, like never before, because today we have  tremendous  power  in  our  hands.  With  modern  science  and  technology, tomorrow  if  we  want,  we  can  flatten  a  mountain  or  city. When  we  have  this  much power  in  our  hands,  it  is  very,  very  important  that  we  have  an  inner  sense,  an awareness  of  life,  and  that  we  experience  life  and  everyone  as  part  of  ourselves. Otherwise,  we  can  create  a  calamity  for  ourselves  and  the  world  around  us—which right  now  we  are  doing  to  some  extent.  This  has  happened  only  because  we  have attended  only  to  the  external  science.  We  have  never  looked  at  the  inner  science within us. Just as there is an external science to create external wellbeing, there is an inner science to create inner wellbeing.</p>

<p>Yoga  can  be  transmitted  on  many  different  levels.  One  is  towards  one’s  physical  and mental wellbeing which includes health and other aspects. Or it could be transmitted as  a  tool  for  ultimate  wellbeing;  in  the  sense,  you  can  use  this  system  as  a  stepping stone to go beyond. If you want, you can use this yoga just to get rid of your backache or  you  can  use  this  yoga  to  get  better  mental  focus  and  a  little  peace  of  mind  and happiness in your life, or you can use this yoga as a way of climbing up to the highest possibility within yourself.</p>

<p>Using yoga just for health is not wrong, but it is a crime, because it can be a ladder to the divine. It is a way of approaching the Creator through the Creation. It can take you to places where you have never imagined. It is my wish and blessing that you should know  the  joy  of  being  truly  well,  not  just  physical  wellbeing,  but  to  know  and  exude wellbeing in all dimensions of your existence.”</p>

<h2> What Is Hatha Yoga?</h2> 

<p>“Essentially,  once  we  use  the  word “yoga”  attached  to anything,  it indicates  in the  tradition  that  it  is  a complete path by itself. “Hatha” has the word  “yoga” attached  to  it because Hatha Yoga is a complete path by itself.  If it is a complete path by itself, how it should  be  approached  is  the question.  If it was just a simple practice, you can approach  it one  way.  If  it  was  an exercise you could have approached it another  way.  If  it  was  an  art  form  it could  be  approached another  way.  Or if  it  is  just  entertainment,  it  could  be approached another way.</p>

<figure>

<p>I am using all these examples because all these things have been said about yoga, and they are still in usage in today’s world. People say “recreational yoga,” “health yoga”- people are referring to it as an art form. They think they are doing a service to yoga by saying it is an art form. No. The moment you attach the word “yoga,” it indicates it is a complete path by itself.</p>

<p>In  most  Indian  languages,  in  common  usage,  the  word  “hatha”  means  being  adamant. This is the quality that you will need. Your body says, “Enough, I had it.” But you are adamant. This  is  Hatha  Yoga. Your mind says, “I give up, I can’t do this anymore.”  But you  are  adamant,  you  simply  do  it.  We  want  to  take  the  physical  form  beyond  its present  levels  of  limitations.  In  a  way,  Hatha  Yoga  means  you  want  to  make  your comfort zone universal. Right now, for most people, their comfort zone is a very small band.  If  you  make  your  comfort  zone  universal,  wherever  you  are,  however you  are, you  are  at  ease.  If  I  make  you  stand  on  your  head,  you  are  still  at  ease.  Hell  will  not work for you; you are adamant enough to frustrate the devil.</p>

<p>So  Hatha  Yoga  is  about  creating  a  body  which  is  not  a  hurdle  in  one’s  life.  The  body becomes  a  stepping  stone—not  a  hurdle,  not  a  roadblock—in  one’s  progress  of blossoming into his ultimate possibility.”</p>

–  Sadhguru

<h2>The Sacred Science of Yoga</h2>

<p>Initially,  yoga  was  imparted  by  the  Adiyogi  (the  first  yogi),  Shiva,  over  15,000  years ago. It was Adiyogi who introduced to humanity the idea that one can evolve beyond one’s present level of existence. He poured this knowing into the legendary Sapta Rishis, or “seven sages,” who carried this powerful yogic science to various parts of the world, including  Asia,  ancient  Persia,  northern  Africa,  and  South  America.    For  generations, countless masters, holding it above their own lives, have passed on this sacred thread of knowledge without a single distortion.</p>

<h4>“The word ‘yoga’ literally means ‘union.’ When you experience everything as one in your consciousness, then you are in yoga.”
‐ Sadhguru</h4>

<p>Classical yoga comprises various methods to elevate and purify one’s energies and raise one’s perception to its peak.  Today, however,  the  refined  tools  of  classical  yoga have  been  largely  lost  or  grossly  distorted  due  to  socio‐cultural  misunderstandings that  have  accumulated  over  many  centuries. Only  in  a  very  few  places,  the  classical system endures with its full vibrancy and sanctity.  Moreover, access to this system has been  traditionally  reserved  for  the  bold  seekers  and  monks  who  devote  their entire lives to spiritual sadhana and austerity.</p>

<p>It  is  Sadhguru’s  vision  to  revive  this  ancient  science  in  all  its  purity  and  make  it available to every individual. As a step towards realizing this vision, he has devised the Hatha  Yoga  Teacher  Training  Program.  Here,  Hatha  Yoga  will  be  taught  not  just  for theoretical understanding, but as a living experience. Upon completion of the program, trainees  will  have  the  privilege  and  fulfillment  of  bringing  this  knowledge  to  many more.</p>
